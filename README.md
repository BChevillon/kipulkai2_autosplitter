# **KiPulKai : la légende des 3 masques - Auto Splitter**

An auto splitter script for LiveSplit, designed to automate timing splits for KiPulKai : la légende des 3 masques. This script reads and monitors in-game data to accurately trigger splits at predefined checkpoints. The initial start of the timer must be done manually before the script takes over.

An auto splitter automates the process of recording split times during a speedrun by detecting specific in-game events. This particular implementation is designed to provide indicative timing rather than frame-perfect accuracy, serving as a general reference for runners.

## **Usage in LiveSplit**

1. **Open LiveSplit** and go to **"Edit Splits..."**.
2. Set the game name to **"KiPulKai : la légende des 3 masques"**.
3. Click **"Activate"** under the **Auto Splitter** section.
4. If the script does not load automatically:
   - Go to **"Edit Layout..."**.
   - Click **"Add Component"** → **"Control"** → **"Scriptable Auto Splitter"**.
   - Select and load `kipulkai_lld3m.asl`.
5. Save your configuration and test with the game.
